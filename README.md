# ParticulateMatter2.5Pollution

Greater London is one of the busiest cities in the world which relies on high human
productivity to maintain itself as a key transit and service hub. It is therefore key to maintain
a healthy environment to host a healthy and productive working population. In the light of
covid19, it is of significance for societies to identify and mitigate factors that are detrimental
to health and well-being of the population.
Air pollution is one area which needs great attention and investments due to its very adverse
impact on human health as elaborated further in this journal. Particulate matter (PM2.5)
pollutant which gained a lot attention in recent time due to it adverse impact on human health
is selected for this study.
Statistical analysis is carried out to identify the relationships between PM2.5 emissions,
associated with comorbidities and Covid19 mortality within Greater London. The same data
is used to build a risk-assessment ML model and its model metric is analysed for
performance. The PM2.5 average readings from monitoring stations across Greater London
and Great Britain is collated for the first 6 months of past 4 years is used along with vehicle
usage data during the Covid-19 restriction period for identifying patterns and reductions in
emissions. Results and key findings from the analysis is used to explain the performance and
validity of various methods and models. Based on the analysis and findings,
recommendations to reduce the PM2.5 pollution is provided.
